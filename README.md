Shiny App

The Shiny App was built as a tool for doing investigation into the raw data looking at the different tables, reviewing the fields, checking the distribution of the values, looking for missing data etc. The long term goal is to build an application that greatly facilitates investigation into any data sets.

The App was then extended to include presentation slides to provide a one-stop application for the end of semester presentation. This required changing the layout and font sizes to ensure they will work on an overhead projector. Hence the final application does not make optimum use of screen layout as it could (or did).
